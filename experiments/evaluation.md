# Evaluation of MDT and AI Recommendations

This document describes how treatment recommendations generated by the
Multidisciplinary Tumor Board and by the experimental frameworks were evaluated and classified
for concordance analysis.

## Outcome Classification

Both MDT and AI recommendations were independently classified by two blinded
board clinicians into one of the following **nine therapeutic categories**:

1. **Best Supportive Care**  
2. **Further Diagnostics**  
3. **Endoscopic Intervention** (e.g., endoscopic resection)  
4. **Active Surveillance or Follow-up**  
5. **Multimodal Therapy**  
   (concurrent application of different treatment modalities, e.g. radiochemotherapy)  
6. **Multistep Therapy**  
   (sequential administration of distinct treatments, e.g. neoadjuvant chemotherapy → surgery → adjuvant chemotherapy)  
7. **Surgery**  
   (invasive surgical procedures requiring general anesthesia)  
8. **Systemic Therapy**  
   (including chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy)  
9. **Localized Therapy**  
   (e.g., radiotherapy, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), TACE, SBRT)

## Examples of Classification

The table below provides illustrative examples of MDT recommendations and their
corresponding outcome classification.
All examples were originally formulated in German and here translated into English for clarity and consistency.

| MDT Recommendation (English translation) | Assigned Category |
|-----------------------------------------|------------------|
| The board recommends **definitive radiochemotherapy** of the proximal esophagus with 50–50.4 Gy and concurrent weekly carboplatin/paclitaxel (CROSS-oriented), without neoadjuvant therapy. A PET-CT for final staging and radiation planning should be performed before treatment initiation, while continuing PEG-based nutritional support. | **Multimodal Therapy** |
| The board recommends **neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection**. Given the deep tumor infiltration (T2–3) and positive lymph node findings (uN+), purely endoscopic therapy is insufficient. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is intended to reduce tumor burden and decrease the risk of local and systemic metastases prior to curative resection. | **Multistep Therapy** |
| The board recommends **primary curative surgical resection** (pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy) for a resectable pancreatic head lesion without vascular invasion or distant metastases. Neoadjuvant therapy is not indicated. | **Surgery** |
| The board currently recommends **no primary surgery**, but histological confirmation by prompt re-endoscopy with multiple deep biopsies (± EUS-guided FNA of suspicious lymph nodes) and complete staging, including diagnostic laparoscopy in the presence of free fluid. After confirmation of malignancy without distant metastases and cardiopulmonary optimization, curative distal gastrectomy may be considered. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not recommended at this stage due to decompensated heart failure. | **Further Diagnostics** |
| Due to advanced age, significant cardiovascular comorbidities, and diffuse signet-ring cell histology, the board recommends a **strictly palliative approach** with retention of the antral stent and endoscopic surveillance. Surgery and systemic tumor therapy are not recommended. Symptom-oriented supportive care (PPI, antiemetics, pain management, nutritional counseling, enteral/parenteral support if needed) and endoscopic re-intervention in case of stent dysfunction are advised; palliative radiotherapy only in case of bleeding or pain. | **Best Supportive Care** |
| No further adjuvant therapy is recommended, as the rectal cancer is staged as UICC I (pT1 cM0 L0 V0 Pn0 R0, G2) after R0 resection, and adjuvant treatment is not indicated according to guidelines. However, endoscopic follow-up after six months is recommended to exclude recurrence. | **Active Surveillance / Follow-up** |
| The board recommends **radiofrequency ablation (RFA)** of the remaining lesion in liver segment II, as this technique represents an effective and minimally invasive option for small tumors (<3 cm) located near vessels, particularly in patients with good performance status and no major vascular invasion or extrahepatic metastases. | **Localized Therapy** |
| The board recommends performing an endoscopic full-thickness resection. This decision is based on the confirmed diagnosis of a gastric neuroendocrine tumor G2 with a Ki-67 index of 7.2%, absence of distant metastases on PET/CT, and suspicion of residual local disease. Surgical wedge resection is not required given the tumor location and the current clinical context. | **Endoscopic Intervention** |
| The board recommends considering re-exposure to gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel and performing tumor genomic sequencing to identify potential targeted therapeutic options. | **Systemic Therapy** |

## Notes on Classification

- The classification reflects the **dominant therapeutic intent** of the recommendation.
- Diagnostic or supportive measures accompanying a definitive treatment do not alter
  the primary category.
- When sequential strategies are explicitly planned (e.g., diagnostics → chemotherapy → surgery),
  the recommendation is classified as **Multistep Therapy**.
