## Dummy Guideline Corpora

This folder contains synthetic guideline excerpts provided solely to demonstrate the structure and functionality of the retrieval pipeline.

No copyrighted guideline text is included.
No clinical use is intended.

The real study used German S3 and NCCN guidelines accessed under institutional licenses.


Some corpus chunks intentionally include <chart> tags and embedded JSON tables. These elements represent text extracted from guideline figures and tables via OCR and table parsing.

This heterogeneous formatting reflects real-world multimodal guideline documents and is preserved to demonstrate the robustness of the retrieval pipeline.
