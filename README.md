Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework for gastrointestinal oncology tumor board decision support

This repository accompanies the manuscript:

"Toward AI Tumor Boards: Retrieval-Augmented Generation Improves Concordance
in Gastrointestinal Oncology" (npj Digital Medicine).

## Purpose

The repository provides full transparency of the methodological framework,
prompting strategies, retrieval logic, and evaluation pipelines used in the study.

Due to patient privacy regulations and copyright restrictions,
no real patient data or guideline documents are included.

## What is Included

- Prompt templates and examples for all experimental configurations
- Retrieval and RAG orchestration logic
- Evaluation scripts (concordance, Jaccard similarity)
- Dummy patient cases and synthetic guideline corpora
- Configuration matrix for the 16 experimental setups

## What is Not Included

- Real patient-level clinical data
- Copyrighted guideline texts (German S3, NCCN)
- API keys or credentials

## Reproducibility

The repository enables methodological replication of the study design,
prompt engineering strategies, and evaluation framework.
Synthetic data are provided to demonstrate end-to-end execution.

## Disclaimer

This code is for research purposes only and is not intended for clinical use.
